% Global model needs:
%   superset core+non-core reactions (non-consistent)
%   core reactions
%   GPRs

% Generic model needs:
%   superset core+non-core reactions (consistent)
%   core reactions (GPRs no longer needed)

% Pruned (r-removed) model needs:
%   creation of core-inactivating dead-ends
%   creation of core-neutral dead-ends
